## About the Project:

Just a simple project created for college, in Computer Science. We were asked to create a simple application in Python, and so I created this.

ENEM is a national test run by the Brazilian government, in order to grant scholarships to students, as long as they get a good grade. This application consists of adding up the student's grades to obtain a simple average.

## For students:

- Below 400: Terrible
- 400-500: Very Bad
- 500-550: Bad
- 551-590: Regular
- 591-600: Good
- 601-699: Very good
- 700-799: Incredible
- Above 800: Perfect

## To execute

To run this project, you will need at least Python 3.8 or higher. Just run "MEDIA.py".
